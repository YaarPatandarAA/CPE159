<h3>Goals</h3>

<ol>
<li>
In the previous OS phase a new process can run within a confined
4KB memory page. In this phase a virtual space of 1GB will be given,
ranging from byte 500M (VM_START, 0x20000000) to byte 1.5G-1
(VM_END, 0x5fffffff).
<p>
<li>
Virtual space is supported by real DRAM pages but only partially for
current runtime of processes. The hardware device that translates
virtual addresses is the <i>Memory Management Unit (MMU)</i>. Each
address the CPU uses to fetch instruction or access data is to be
first translated by the MMU <i>on the fly</i> before giving to the
cache system to check whether it is a cache hit, etc.
<p>
<li>
The process created by the <i>SYS_EXEC</i> service will become virtual.
The instruction of the process will start from VM_START (0x20000000),
and the process stack will end at VM_END (0x5fffffff), 1 GB.
<p>
<li>
In ExecService() the translation table (<i>TT</i>) the MMU needs will be
created. When a virtual process is selected to run, before ProcLoader(),
the MMU will be given the translation table by: <i>set_cr3(pcb[run_pid].TT)</i>.
And when the process ends, the MMU will be given back the original TT
(<i>OS_TT</i>) to use.
<p>
<li>
The OS_TT is created during the OS bootstrap for the kernel to use. The
first 4 entries of it will be part of the newly created TT for the virtual
process in order to map to the area of the kernel services.
</ol>

<h3>Virtual Address Translation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The Intel MMU uses a <i>two-tier</i> translation procedure: the first
10 bits in the 32-bit virtual address is taken as the entry number of
a main translation table to get the real address of a <i>subtable</i>.
And, the next 10 bits in the virtual address is the entry number of
the subtable to get the real address of a DRAM page to get the address
of an instruction or data. The rest 12 bits in the virtual address are
not changed (as the byte number in the DRAM page).
<p>
<li>
The PCB will need an <b><i>int TT</b></i>, the address of the main
translation table for the process, and <i><b>int page[5]</b></i> to
record 5 DRAM page numbers in use. If the TT in PCB is not NUL, call
<i>set_cr3()</i></b> to set MMU before calling ProcLoader(), in order
to have the virtual address VM_TF (PCB trapframe address) translated.
<p>
<li>
A valid entry in the main table is set with a real address of a subtable
(which occupies a whole DRAM page), and, a valid entry in a subtable is
set with a real address of a DRAM page carrying process instructions or
runtime stack. Entries not yet set are invalid, and the MMU will issue
a <i>not-present</i> page-fault CPU exception. Therefore, there are
flags like <i>valid</i> in each entry of a table to be set as the table
is created. More on setting flags below.
<p>
<li>
The ExecService() will start by allocating five (not one) DRAM pages
to create a main address-translation table (<i>TT</i>), one instruction
table (<i>IT</i>), one stack table (<i>ST</i>), , one instruction page
(<i>IP</i>) and one stack page (<i>SP</i>). A table has 1024 entries
and each entry is 4 bytes in size so a table is 4KB (a DRAM page).
<p>
<li>
Two entries in TT point to IT and ST. Since the virtual space starts
at 0.5GB (0x20000000B) and its first 10 bits will be read by MMU as
entry number 0010 00000 00<sub>2</sub> to look into TT for a DRAM address
where IT is, and the next 10 bits of 0.5G (00 0000 0000) is read as the
entry number in IT to get where IP is, and the rest 12 bits of 0.5G
is the address into this IP, to get an instruction.
<p>
<li>
The process argument and trapframe will be created at the end of the
virtual space (VM_END, 0x5fffffff) in which the 1st 10 bits 
0111 0000 00<sub>2</sub> is the entry number of TT for address of ST;
the 2nd 10 bits 11 1111 1111<sub>2</sub> is the entry number of ST for
address of SP; and the rest 12 bits are address in SP to fetch data.
<p>
<li>
The beginning 4 entries of OS_TT will be copied to the process TT when
making it. The SPEDE function <i>int get_cr3()</i> will obtain this address
during kernel data initialization. When reclaiming DRAM pages of a process
the MMU should switched back to OS_TT, otherwise, the computer will reboot
since the translation tables is lost (as the TT page is being erased).
<p>
<li>
The EIP in the virtual process trapframe should be set at VM_START
(0x20000000), and the process trapframe address in its PCB should be
set to <i>VM_TF</i>, a constant that is 1.5G (0x60000000) minus the
size of the trapframe and two integers (for an argument and NUL).
</ol>

<h3>MMU Translation Mechanism</h3>

<ol>
<li>
The Intel MMU uses a 2-tier translation scheme (a main table paired with several
subtables), in order to occupy less DRAM space: given a 32-bit virtual address,
it is read into 3 parts:
the first 10 bits (TT entry number), the second 10 bits (IT/ST entry number),
and the rest 12 bits (byte offset in the instruction/stack page):
   <ol type=i>
   <li>TT has 6 valid entries (pointing to 6 subtables). The first 4 entries are
       copied from OS_TT. Other 2 entries hold addresses of IT and ST.
   <li>IT: the 1st entry holds the address of IP.
   <li>ST: the last entry holds the address of SP.
   <li>IP has the process instructions.
   <li>SP has the process trapframe (EIP set to VM_START), and the process argument.
   <li>PCB trapfrme pointer points to VM_END minus the size of a trapframe and two integers.
   </ol>
<p>
<li>
Before a process is loaded to run in kernel(), use <i>set_cr3()</i> to
inform the MMU to swtich TT if the TT the process has is not NUL.
<p>
<li>
Since each DRAM page is at an intervals of 4K bytes in the memory, only
the first 20 bits in an address may change. The unchanged 12 bits (zeros)
are used in a table entry as the attribute flags for the DRAM page the
address points to. The rightmost 7 flags are:
<ol type=a>
<li><tt>PRESENT</tt>, 0: page not present, 1: page present.
<li><tt>RO / RW</tt> , 0: page is read-only, 1: read-writable
<li><tt>USER MODE</tt>, 0: superuser to access, 1: user can access
<li><tt>CACHE POLICY</tt>, 0: write back; 1: write-through (if cache-use set)
<li><tt>CACHE USE</tt>, 0: page content not to be cached, 1: to be cached
<li><tt>ACCESSED</tt>, 0: entry never looked up by MMU, 1: accessed
<li><tt>DIRTY</tt>, 0: page content not changed/written, 1: changed/written
</ol>
<p>
<li>
We will only set the RW and Present flags to 1. Others 0. This is done in
ExecService() as each entry is being initialized during the creation of
TT, IT, and ST.
<p>
<li>
The target PC will reboot once a conflict against any flags occur during
the runtime: "page not present, write to a read-only page, process in the
user mode accessing kernel-mode page, etc. Hence, use GDB to verify each
entry is correctly set at the end of ExecService().
<p>
<li>
Services for sys_exit() and sys_waitchild() will need to deal with the
complications caused by virtual space: since a <i>zombie</i> child no
longer runs, the translation table will need to be switched back to the
original OS' table. In order to reference into the child's virtual space
to get the exit code by WaitchildService(), the MMU will need the child's
translation table briefly to resolve the virtual address of the trapframe
location in child's PCB.
</ol>

<h3>Demo Run</h3>
<blockquote>
The demo runs exactly like the previous phase, but the code is a lot more
sophisticated. The virtual memory requires the management of DRAM pages
and correctly switching translation tables.
</blockquote>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
Source files as usual, other restrictions and requirements of not conducting
plagiarism as usual (see the deiverable description in previous phases).
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Where in your programs the get_cr3() and set_cr3() functions are used?
<p>
<li>
What are the type of page faults that may occur as the MMU looks
into a table entry during an address translation?
<p>
<li>
How to write code to trigger page faults so it will need new pages
allocated during runtime? How should your OS handle this? Wouldn't
the recovery of a page fault requires rolling back the instruction
pointer to retry the intruction?
<p>
<li>
What is the pragmatic purpose of the 2-tier translation scheme?
<p>
<li>
What are the functions of the UNIX "pagedaemon" and "swapper" processes?
<p>
<li>
How can our OS maintain a healthy proportion of DRAM space not used?
How can LRU counts be implemented? How to indicate a page was swapped
out in the swap space (not brand new)?
<p>
<li>
Can translation tables also be subject to swapped in and out with a
"swap disk partition" like normal process pages?
<p>
<li>
The MMU has TLB to cache table entries. The instruction and data are
cached separately. Should the search for a cache hit be based on a
virtual or real address?
<p>
<li>
Information interchanged between two virtual processes, in kernel
services such as the exit code. What if the parent exit_code_p is
also a virtual address?
<p>
<li>
How to service shared memory pages (shared-memory IPC)?
