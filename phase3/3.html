<big><b>Description and Goal</big></b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
In this OS development phase we extend the OS services to an Interprocess
Communication (IPC) method called <i>semaphore</i>. It provides a protocol
for processes to collaborate and avoid the "racing/collision" conditions
which may occur in their collective operation.
<p>
<li>
To test the semaphore services, a single <i><b>semaphore_t video_sem</b></i>
will be allocated to use by UsurProc(). A semaphore has a <i>value</i> that
counts a control number and a <i>wait queue</i> for processes when they are
being blocked by the semaphore control. The access to the video display of
the target PC will be <i>guarded</i> by the video semaphore.
<p>
<li>
As multiple processes access a common I/O or data region, a mechanism to
guarantee for a mutual exclusion is required, in order to avoid any
<i>racing</i> condition. Each process shall first reqeuest the access
before proceeding to perform a read or write operation. If the request
is granted (by checking a control value in the semaphore), the process
may continue to run. When access is denied, the process will be blocked
and placed in the semaphore wait queue.
<p>
<li>
A process that first requests the semaphore shall normally later issue
to return it after use. This may release any blocked processes (blocked
during the two above events). The process code between requesting the
semaphore and returning it is called the critical code section since it
is usually where access of guarded critical data occurs.

</ol>
<p>

<big><b>Semaphore Services</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
There are two API calls: <i><b>void sys_semwait(int sem_num)</i></b>
to <i>request</i> to pass the semaphore control, and <i><b>void
sys_sempost(int sem_num)</i></b> to return the usage of the semaphore.
The two API calls subsequently evokes the run of the services of
<i><b>void SemwaitService(int sem_num)</i></b> and <b><i>void
SempostService(int sem_num)</b></i>.
<p>
<li>
The <b><i>void SemwaitService(int sem_num)</b></i> first checks if the
control value of the semaphore (<b><i>val</i></b>) is greater than zero.
If so, it is downcounted, and the process is not blocked. If the control
value is zero, the calling process will be "blocked:" its PID is enqueued
to the wait queue in the semaphore, its state is altered to <b><i>WAIT</b></i>.
And, the running PID is reset (no longer there).
<p>
<li>
The <i><b>void SempostService(int sem_num)</b></i>, on the otherhand,
first checks if the wait queue in the semaphore is empty. If so, it
uncount the control value. If not empty, the 1st waiting process will
be released: its PID is thus dequeued from the wait queue and moved to
the ready PID queue, and its state is also updated.

<big><b>Deliverables</big></b>
<p>

<blockquote>
Source code only dropped to your destinated dropbox folder on the host
Voyager as before. Use the correct folder. Incorrect usage including
excessive irrelevant files and folder creations will incur penalty of
grade-point deduction!
<br>
Inclusion of code from past semesters will be deemed as plagiarism (<b>
<i>F-grade warning</i></b>).
Not meeting the OS phase requirements will incur serious grade point deduction.

<big><b>Review Questions</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
What is the difference of a mutex and semaphore?
<p>
<li>
Enter shell command on an ECS Linux host: ipcs -l for the information
of IPC service parametrics in the system. Where are the "config" files
an OS administrator use to set these resources? (/etc/sysctl.conf and
/proc/sys/kernel/sem)
<p>
<li>
When a process doesn't call sys_semwait() after a sys_sempost(), may a
deadlock likely to occur?
How can an OS be vigilant enough to detect this conditions? Can an OS
be effective to resolve it? Is the OS obligated to do so?
<p>
<li>
What are the definition and conditions of process <i>starvation</i>,
<i>deadlock</i>, and <i>livelock</i>? Can they be illustrated by run code?
</ol>
