Phase 2 &nbsp; Intro to Kernel Service Calls
</h3>
</center>

<b>Kernel Services</tt></b>
<ol>
<li>
During the runtime, a process may call for kernel services. The system
service calls are coded in files <b><i>syscalls.c/.h</b></i>. The duty of an
OS is to fullfill the requests and execute the service code. While doing
so, the process is to be supended (trapped), await for the service, and
then be resumed. A <tt>UserProc()</tt> will make requests for three OS
services: <b><i>sys_write()</i></b>, <b><i>sys_getpid()</i></b>, and
<i><b>sys_sleep()</i></b>.
To perform a service for the calling process requires the CPU to suspend
the execution of the process in order to perform the service code. After,
the process may either be resumed or otherwise due to the outcome of the
service requested (I/O waits, semaphores, resources lacking, etc.).
<li>
Service calls are initiated by the functions coded in <b><i>syscalls.c</i></b>
in which <i>inline</i> assembly of CPU instructions are embedded. It
invokes the kernel via a software interrupt event; particularly, through
the execution of the CPU instruction <i><b>int $128</i></b>.
Different from handling a hardware interrupt such as the timer device,
there is no PIC mask to set or IRQ to dismiss. Only the entry #128 in the
IDT will need to carry the address of <i><b>SyscallEntry</i></b> which leads
to the execution of the kernel and hence the service routine code.
<li>
The kernel service code <i><b>GetpidService</i></b> placed the PID
(<i><b>run_pid</i></b>) in the process trapframe (<i><b>ebx</i></b>) to be
loaded to the CPU.
After "int $128" the process resumes inside the syscall code, e.g.,
<i><b>sys_getpid()</i></b>, it retrieves the PID via the CPU register
<i><b>ebx</i></b> as the function return.
<li>
The <i><b>TimerEntry</i></b> and <i><b>SyscallEntry</i></b> are both
coded in <i>entry.S</i>. Each will <i>push</i> its own interrupt number
(<i><b>intr_num</i></b>) into the process trapframe and <i>jmp</i> to a
common routine that switch to the kernel stack and runs the kernel code.
The intrrupt number is used in the kernel code to identify the interrupt
for the choice of the service routine.
<li>
More coding details are listed in <i><b>CodingHints.txt</i></b>.
</ol>

<b>Enable Kernel Services</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
The <i><b>SYSCALL</i></b> (constant 128) is the IDT entry where the
address of <tt><b>SyscallEntry</tt></b> in <i><b>entry.S</i></b>
is in-placed. While TimerEntry pushes TIMER (32) SyscallEntry will
push 128 instead. After, both jump to a common routine <i><b>EnterKernel</b></i>
to complete the rest of the trapframe, switch stack, push the
trapframe address like how the original TimerEntry was coded.
<li>
Different from the the timer interrupt, a syscall interrupt does not
need to program the PIC mask or dismiss an IRQ. However, program files
<i><b>syscalls.c/.h</i></b> where <b><i>asm()</i></b> macros are needed
to have CPU instructions embedded. This includes <i><b>int $128</b></i>
in order to "voluntarily" interrupt the process and switch the CPU to
execute the SyscallEntry code.
<li>
Each syscall function should send in arguments (if any needed) to the
kernel for the service, and receive results from the kernel (if any)
after the service. The inline assembly of CPU instructions can do these.
</ol>

<b>Kernel Service Code</b>
<ol>
<li>
Service code are collected in files <b><i>services.c/.h</b></i>.
Based on the service number set in the register eax by the syscall.
This will be examined in the process trapframe -- the process PCB
has the pointer to the trapframe.
<li>
For the <i><b>sys_getpid()</i></b> call, the service number is
<b><i>SYS_GETPID</i></b> (20), and <i><b>GetpidService()</i></b>
will be called to service this. What is to be done is to return
the running PID (<i><b>run_pid</i></b>) to the process via the
process trapframe (register ebx) which will be loaded back by
ProcLoader as the process resumes. The syscall code will continue
(after <i><b>int $128</i></b>) and thus retrieve it as the funtion
return.
<li>
The <i><b>sys_write()</i></b> call sends the kernel with service
number <i><b>SYS_WRITE </i></b> (4) via CPU register eax, along
with other needed information: <i><b>STDOUT</i></b> (1) in ebx,
and the address of the character string to be printed in ecx, and
the string length in edx.
<li>
The <i><b>WriteService()</i></b> needs to be carefully and correctly
done. The STDOUT means the character string is to be displayed onto
the target PC console via its VGA memory access where the video address
<i><b>unsigned short 0xb8000</i></b> represents the top-left corner.
There are 25 rows and 80 columns. Each position is a two-byte value
composed by the ASCII code of the character to be displayed, and
the video <i>mask</i> (<i><b>0x0f00</i></b>) for "boldface on black."
The service will have its VGA pointer initially set at the top-left
corner and it gets incremented at the displaying of each character.
As the VGA pointer reaching the bottom-right corner, it should wrap
back to the top-left corner. A total erasure of the whole display
screen should be conducted before restarting from the top-left.
<li>
Given the number of <i><b>centi-seconds</i></b> to sleep as the function
argument, a <b><i>sys_sleep()</i></b> call of a process will start
<b><i>SleepService()</i></b> which updates the wake-up time in the process
PCB by the current OS time <i><b>current_time</i></b> adding the sleep time
requested. The state of the process is then changed to <i>SLEEP</i> and
the running PID is reset to -1.
<li>
The <i><b>TimerService()</i></b> will be boosted (added) with new code which does:

<ol>
<li> upcount the current OS time (<i><b>current_time</i></b>),
<li> check all processes (loop through the PCB array):
<ul>
<li> if in the SLEEP state, and the wake time matches current OS time,
<li> then enqueue the PID to the ready PID queue, and update its state.
</ul>
</ol>

</ul>
</ol>

<b>Deliverables</b>
<ul>
As before, to <i>Voyager</i> via <i>smbclient</i>, submit only source files
(not any other files generated by SPEDE or the compiler) into your team folder
under the folder <i>phase2</i>. Misplacement incurs penalty.
</ul>

<b>Review Questions</b>
<ol>
<li>
Point out the differences between setting up and servicing of a hardware
interrupt (such as the timer interrupt), and a software syscall?
<li>
Why bother to save the process trapframe pointer at the beginning of Kernel()?
<li>
How to check the wake time against the current OS time? Is the use of "=="
sufficiently correct? Or, is the use of ">=" really needed?
<li>
What can happen with <i>your</i> current code if testing with "sys_sleep(0)"
or "sys_sleep(-1)?" How does a real OS handle these exceptions?
<li>
Can the current OS time become different to the real time (wall clock) after
a sufficiently lengthy runtime?
<li>
What differs a "cooperative" OS versus a "preemptive" one? What are the
pros and cons of these two types of OS?
