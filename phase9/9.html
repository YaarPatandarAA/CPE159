<big><b>Phase 9 &nbsp; Real Memory Space: <i>Exec,</i> Minion of Fork</big></b>
</center>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In this OS phase, the DRAM resource will be managed by our kernel.
It will be allocated to create new processes by the unit of memory
page.
<li>
<p>
A new <tt>SYS_EXEC 11</tt> service will be used for a new forked
child to request a new space for new runtime code. This is also
how an external shell command is done, by having a child process
first forked and then <i>execute</i> a separate compiled program
code. We will continue to use the same child code from the previous
phase except now it will be run independently with its own runtime
space for its code, data, and stack; all outside of <i>MyOS.dli</i>.
<p>
<li>
The new kernel service call is <i><b>void sys_exec(func_p_t p, int
arg)</b></i> where <i>p</i> is the address of <i>ChildStuff()</i>
and <i>arg</i> is its argument (either <i>TERM1</i> or TERM2</i>)
inherited from the parent code. In order to create a process with
an argument, the argument must be asserted above its initial 
trapframe for it to obtain it when run. This is similar to how
the <i>wrapper</i> can get an argument when running in the previous
OS phase.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Memory Mangement</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Memory are DRAM pages, managed by our OS to allocate for processes.
The OS will maintain the usage information, namely, by a single
<b><i>page_q</i></b> (same as the pid_q_t).
<p>
<li>
During the OS bootstrap, all page numbers will be queued into the
<i>page_q</i>. Each number is associated with a DRAM address which
is based on a 4KB (4096B) interval starting at 14MB (0xe00000), i.e.,
page number 0 starts at address 0xe00000, page 1 at 0xe01000, page 2
at 0xe02000, etc. Hence, by the page number, the address can be
calculated immediately when needed.
<p>
<li>
The PCB will record the page numbers used by the process when each
page is being allocated (dequeued from <i>page_q</i>), and returned
(enqueued back to <i>page_q</i>). Therefore, beside the page_q
and extra information in the PCB, there are no special data structures
needed to manage the memory resource for this OS phase.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Exec Service</h3>
<ol>
<li>
As a process is serviced, a DRAM page will be allocated to copy in
the program code, and the trapframe will also be copied to into
this page as well, but with the instruction pointer altered to
point to the new program code. Hence, the process will start
from the new code.
<p>
<li>
However, if an argument is to be passed to the child process to
use it, the service must lower the trapframe by two <i>notches</i>
(for the same reason as that in the previous OS phase) in order
to insert the argument (and a NUL -- voided return address) right
above the trapframe.
<p>
<li>
The Wait and Exit services now must also reclaim both the DRAM
page when the child finishes using. Thes page number information
is in the PCB of the child.
<p>
<li>
The need to rename <i>syscalls.c</i> to <i>proc_syscalls.c</i>
is to have syscall function code closer to the child process
code, to fit into the single 4KB DRAM space. Otherwise, the
syscalls are too far to jump to.
</ol>

<h3>Test Run Demo</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The demo files will run the same way as those in the prevous phase.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h events.S) to your
team dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess
up submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What can be the reason of having DRAM resource leaks?
<p>
<li>
Why do we need to rename syscalls.c? What if we do not rename it?
Are there alternatives such as the child process code does not rely
on external identifiers?
</ol>
