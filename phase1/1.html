<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Our OS will be driven by the timer device to conduct kernel services.
We have learned how the timer works in the previous phase. The creation,
scheduling, and running of a simple process will be carried out.
<li>
There are pseudo code given in the <i><b>P-code</b></i> folder to help
you construct this OS phase. How timer events are services will be crucial
to the construction of this phase. The use of a process trapframe to achieve
a CPU context switching is also required here.
<li>
Copy the given files can be easily done by issuing shell command "<b><i>cp
~changw/html/159/1/P-code/* .</i></b>" Note the "dot" symbol at the end means
that the current directory will be the destination.
<li>
Avoid the <i>copy-paste</i> operation from the web browser since it may
incur unwanted <i>ctrl-M</i> characters that can cause compiler errors.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>What's in "P-code"</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The <b><i>P-code</i></b> directory contains some actual and some pseudo
code you need to program. During the bootstrap (main) your OS needs to:
<ul>
<li>initialize all the kernel data the kernel needs,
<li>iniitalize the control environment the kernel needs,
<li>create the first process (<i>IdleProc</i>), and
<li>load the first process to run.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
The <i>IdleProc</i> runs in an infinite loop showing its PID (0) once
a second. The timer event also occurs from the background and triggers
the kernel service code 100 times a second.
<p>
<li>
The timer service counts the runtime of the process in order to
monitor if it reaches a time limit. If so, the kernel would choose
a different process to run if available. A pool of processes that
are ready to run will have their PID's queued in the ready PID queue
(<i>ready_pid_q</i>) to take turns to be selected to run. Our
kernel switches among these processes using the <i>round-robin</i>
process-scheduling policy.
<p>
<li>
The kernel when detecting a special key being pressed on the target
PC, it will service it like an event:
   <ul>
   <li><i><b>n</b></i>, call service <i>NewProcService()</i> to
   create a new process.
   <li><i><b>b</b></i>, calling breakpoint to go to the GDB prompt so
   you can debug code or exit the whole run.
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
One thing the <i>TimerService()</i> performs is to upcount the
<i>runtime</i> of the process (in Process Control Block, PCB)
currently running. When it counts upto <i>TIME_LIMIT</i>, the
process is <i>suspended</i> with its PID moved back to the ready queue.
TimerService() also dismisses IRQ0 (like how it did in the timer lab).
<p>
<li>
The <i>ProcScheduler()</i> of the kernel code dequeues the 1st
PID from the ready PID queue as the running PID unless the queue
is empty, then the PID of IdleProc (0) will be the running PID.
A user process has a higher priority to run than the IdleProc.
<p>
<li>
All the available PID's are initially queued in the available PID queue
(<i>avail_pid_q</i>). The initial state is <i>AVAIL</i>. As a new
process is created, a PID from the available PID queue is taken. Each
PID is also an array index in both arrays: the Process Control Block
(<b>pcb</b>) and Process Runtime Stack (<b>proc_stack</b>). To create
a new process, the NewProcService() code initializes the PCB and creates
a process trapframe in the process stack. The PID is then queued to the
<i>ready_pid_q</i>. The state of process created is READY.
<p>
<li>
The <i>avail_pid_q</i> is initially primed with numbers 0 to 19 (all
the PID's available), while the <i>ready_pid_q</i> is initially empty.
The first process to be created is the <i>IdleProc</i> process, by the
<i>NewProcService()</i> during the OS bootstrap (main). The PID of the
IdleProc is 0 and as an exception, 0 is not queued to the ready_pid_q,
nor is its runtime counted in the TimerService() code.
<p>
<li>
Each of the two PID queues has a 20-integer array <i>int q[]</i> and
<i>int size</i> which indicates the number of PID's currently queued in
the array. The code file <i><b>tools.c</i></b> is to be completed to
facilitate the enqueue and dequeue functions, plus a <i>MyBzero()</i>
function to clear all bytes (to 0) from a given "char *" pointer.
<p>
<li>
A <i>Process Control Block (PCB)</i> contains:
   <ul>
   <li><i>state_t</i> <b>state</b>, process state: AVAIL, READY, or RUN;
   <li><i>int</i> <b>runtime</b>: counting timer interrupts, reset to zero when selected to run;
   <li><i>int</i> <b>totaltime</b>: accumulated runtime of the process after creation;
   <li><i>trapframe_t *</i><b>trapframe_p</b>: location of the saved CPU context in the runtime stack.
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
A trapframe is first created by the <i>NewProcService()</i> code as
the initial CPU context to load to the CPU to start the process run.
The context of the CPU is saved into a process trapframe in the process'
own runtime stack when an interrupt event occurs. Conversely, to resume
the runtime of a process (or to start one) is to load the trapframe back
to the CPU. Given the address of a trapframe, <i>ProcLoader()</i> does this.
A simple version of the <i>process trapframe</i> contains:
   <ul>
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>regs[8]</b>, stack space for 8 CPU registers;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>eip</b>, where process instruction begins;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>cs</b>, process code segment location;
   <li><i>unsigned int</i> <b>efl</b>, CPU flags (including the interrupt flag).
   </ul>
<p>
<li>
The <i>IdleProc</i> process is created during the OS bootstrap code, in
the <i>main()</i> function, and the instruction pointer of the CPU
<i>eip</i> of the process trapframe points to the code of <i>IdleProc()</i>.
For other processes created while pressing the <i>'n'</i> key their <i>eip</i>
will point to the code of the <i>UserProc()</i> instead.
<p>
<li>
The timer interrupt event must be dismissed (as how it was done in the timer lab
exercise) at the time the service is rendered. Otherwise, the <i>PIC</i> will not
notify the CPU for the next timer interrupt event (thinking the CPU is still busy
with the old timer interrupt.)
<p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
By now you should have formed your OS team with others (maximum 3 persons per
team), and mail the instructor: the OS team name and member names. Similar to
naming a variable in program code, a team name may not use spaces or special
symbols, and is case sensitive.
<li>
Submit only the source code files. Do not submit any other files generated
by the compiler or SPEDE tools. Source files are those ending in <b><i>.c</i></b>,
<b><i>.h</b></i>, and <b><i>.S</b></i>.
<li>
Penalty will apply if failing to follow the above instructions, including any
accidental cloberring or incorrect placement of files in the dropbox folders
of the server host Voyager.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What is a process trapframe and how is it used?
<li>
Why <i>asm("sti");</i> is not used in phase 1? (In the timer lab we did.)
<li>
How can the <i>round-robin</i> process scheduling be modified to carry out
other types of scheduling policies such as the shortest-job first?
</ol>
